        <h2>🐶 How to Stop Dog Pee from Ruining Your Lawn — Naturally!</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re a proud dog parent, you know the struggle: one day your grass is lush and green, and the next, yellow spots appear out of nowhere. The culprit? Your dog’s pee.

But don’t worry — you don’t have to choose between your pup and your perfect lawn anymore. <a href="https://amzn.to/3JPruIE" target="_blank">Green Grass Chews</a> offer an easy, natural solution that keeps your yard beautiful <i>and</i> supports your dog’s health.

Let’s break down how they work and why so many pet owners are switching to them.
        </p>
        <h2>🌿 Why Dog Pee Kills Grass</h2>
        <p>
            Dog urine contains nitrogen — the same nutrient found in fertilizer. In small amounts, nitrogen helps grass grow, but in concentrated doses (like a dog’s pee), it burns and kills the grass.

That’s why you see yellow or brown spots appear after your pup goes to the bathroom.
        </p>
